[+] ALL code rewritten
[+] New config system
[+] New ui
[+] Now if there is an error when running nuker, nuker will inform you about it, and it will be easier for you and us to deal with it.
[+] This system also applies to the config system.
[+] Now you can make it so that only whitelisted users can execute nuker commands.
[/] Many features of the old nuker and new features of the new nuker have not been added, but they will be added in the future.
